##  Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. **Checker Compliance Issues** 
   - *Problem:* Project ran correctly locally but failed checker validation. 
   - *Solution:* Refactored and structured code to meet program-specific standards and requirements.

2. **Time Management Constraints** 
   - *Problem:* Some tasks exceeded allocated timeframes. 
   - *Solution:* Prioritized critical milestones and adopted time-blocking techniques for better productivity.

## âœ… Best Practices & Takeaways

- **Write Testable Code** 
  Prioritize writing modular, test-driven code to ensure long-term maintainability.

- **Version Control Discipline** 
  Use Git branches, descriptive commit messages, and follow Git Flow practices for team collaboration.

- **Document As You Code** 
  Maintain clear inline documentation and update README files regularly.

- **Dockerize Early** 
  Containerize applications from the start to ensure consistency across environments.

- **Automate Everything** 
  Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment.

- **Practice Defensive Programming** 
  Anticipate edge cases, validate inputs, and handle exceptions gracefully.

- **Learn by Debugging** 
  Treat errors as learning opportunitiesâ€”use logs, linters, and debuggers effectively.

- **Monitor & Improve** 
  Utilize monitoring tools to track performance, detect issues early, and optimize system efficiency.

- **Collaborate Cross-Functionally** 
  Work with frontend developers to align API responses with UI needs and user expectations.

- **Reflect Regularly** 
  Maintain a monthly log to review progress, adjust strategies, and celebrate small wins.
